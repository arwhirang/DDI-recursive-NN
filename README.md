# DDI-recursive-NN

This is a code repository from the paper "Drug drug interaction extraction using recursive neural network", which is under review.

Note : We only upload the Recursive NN model, which is based on the tree-lstm implementation using the Tensorflow Fold https://github.com/tensorflow/fold/blob/master/tensorflow_fold/g3doc/sentiment.ipynb

Requirements:  
&ensp;Tensorflow ver 1.1&ensp;&ensp;(we do not test the other versions)  
&ensp;Tensorflow Fold https://github.com/tensorflow/fold  
&ensp;python 3.4 or later  
&ensp;Minor:  
&ensp;&ensp;gensim https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/install.html  
&ensp;&ensp;sklearn http://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html  
&ensp;&ensp;numpy  
&ensp;&ensp;nltk

Data:  
&ensp;Use the preprocessed test data in the Demo folder. For the whole DDI'13 corpus, visit : http://labda.inf.uc3m.es/ddicorpus  
&ensp;We report the ids of the training set in the "TrainingSetIDs" file.
